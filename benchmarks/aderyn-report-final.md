# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 80](src/Ownable.sol#L80)

	```solidity
	    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 88](src/Ownable.sol#L88)

	```solidity
	    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 2](src/Gas.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.22;
	```



## L-2: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 2](src/Gas.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.22;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Assigning values to address state variables without checking for `address(0)`.

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 102](src/Ownable.sol#L102)

	```solidity
	        _owner = newOwner;
	```



## NC-2: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 51](src/Gas.sol#L51)

	```solidity
	    function balanceOf(address _user) public view returns (uint256) {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 55](src/Gas.sol#L55)

	```solidity
	    function transfer(
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 65](src/Gas.sol#L65)

	```solidity
	    function addToWhitelist(address _userAddrs, uint256 _tier)
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 80](src/Gas.sol#L80)

	```solidity
	    function whiteTransfer(
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 93](src/Gas.sol#L93)

	```solidity
	    function getPaymentStatus(address sender) public view returns (bool, uint256) {
	```

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 80](src/Ownable.sol#L80)

	```solidity
	    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/Ownable.sol [Line: 88](src/Ownable.sol#L88)

	```solidity
	    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
	```



## NC-3: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 30](src/Gas.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	            for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 43](src/Gas.sol#L43)

	```solidity
	            for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 69](src/Gas.sol#L69)

	```solidity
	        if (_tier > 255) {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 72](src/Gas.sol#L72)

	```solidity
	        if (_tier > 3) {
	```

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 73](src/Gas.sol#L73)

	```solidity
	            whitelist[_userAddrs] = 3;
	```



## NC-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/Gas.sol [Line: 13](src/Gas.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	    event AddedToWhitelist(address userAddress, uint256 tier);
	```
